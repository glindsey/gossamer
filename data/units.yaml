# Basic units (beyond the standard built-ins)
# These are provided as sanity-checks to guard against improper unit-mixing.
#
# Standard built-ins:
#   - int -- Integer number ranging from INT64_MIN to INT64_MAX.
#            "fixed" is a synonym for int and equivalent to "fixed0".
#   - fixedN -- Fixed-point number with N decimal places.
#              Ranges from INT64_MIN/(10^N) to INT64_MAX/(10^N).
#   - color -- 32-bit value in #AARRGGBB (alpha/red/green/blue) format.
#   - string -- UTF-8 string of characters
#   - id -- Object ID
#   - list: <type> -- List of one of the above types
#   - dictionary: <type> -- Dictionary relating strings to one of the above
#                           types
#
# Fixed-point numbers should be written WITHOUT their decimal point in YAML
# files; e.g. the fixed2 number "123.45" should be written "12345".
#
# Floating-point attributes might be added if there's a need for them.
