# An attribute can apply to a material, a property, or a thing.
#
# In the data files, the *value* of an attribute can be set directly in the
# definition of a material/property/thing, or via a qualifier like "usually".
# In the former case, the value is considered to be an "intrinsic" constant; in
# the latter, it is a variable that can change at runtime. In any case, a value
# set for attribute on a thing instance will override its "intrinsic" value
# when queried.
