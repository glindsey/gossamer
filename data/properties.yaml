# A property can apply to a material, another property, or a thing. It is
# essentially a boolean attribute, but is treated separately from them in order
# to allow for cleaner and more legible definitions.
#
# @todo Possibly also make "enumerated" values properties instead of attributes?
#
# In the data files, the existence of an property can be set directly in the
# definition of a material/property/thing, or via a qualifier like "usually".
# In the former case, the property is considered to be an "intrinsic" constant;
# in the latter, it can be set/unset at runtime. In any case, the setting (or
# unsetting) of a property on a thing instance will override its "intrinsic"
# setting when queried.
